                    Software Development Lifecycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality low cast software, in the shortest possible production time.

  The Software Development Life Cycle;
   
            

Waterfall Methodology

The Waterfall Methodology also known as the Waterfall Model, is a sequential development process that flow like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, design, development and testing  for example) with each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins.

       The waterfall Method;

                    
 Downsides

The main drawback in waterfall method is we cannot go to back phase. So if clients need any change in back Phase we cannot do that. To do that change we have to start building again from 1st phase. Due to which a lot of time was wasted if clients need any change
      

Agile Methodology

The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating.

         
       
Downsides

It is not suitable for long term projects. One of the main drawback is that the level of collaboration is difficult to maintain

  DevOps Culture

   DevOps culture is all about  a shared understanding between developers and operations, and sharing responsibility for the software they build. That means increasing transparency, communication, and collaboration across development, It/ operations, and “the business”.


  DevOps

•	DevOps is a methodology meant to improve work throughout the        software development lifecycle.
       •  The term DevOps is the combination of Two Words                                  
          (Development and Operations )
       •  DevOps is the methodology that allows a single team to manage              
           the entire application development life cycle that is development ,     
           testing, Deployment and Operations.
•	It is a Software Development Approach through which superior    
       quality software can be developed quickly and with more realibility.


        


                     Stages of  DevOps

  There are four basic DevOps stages

•	Version Control;
                             Maintain Different version of Code.                                                    The tool used for     
Version Control is “GIT”
 

•	 Continuous Integration; Continuously Compile , build code , Integrate,   testing. The Tool Used for Continuous Integration is “Jenkins”.

•	 Continuous Delivery;
  Continuously Deploying the build app to test server.
The Tool used for Continuous Delivery is “ Maven”.

•	Continuous Deployment;
  Continuous Deploying the test app on the production.

                   Benefits of DevOps

•	Faster, better product delivery.
•	Faster issue resolution and reduce complexity.
•	Greater scalability and availability.
•	More stable operating environments.
•	Better resource utilization.
•	Greater automation.
•	Greater visibility into system outcomes.
•	Greater innovation.
