<b>Software Development Lifecycle</b>

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality low cast software, in the shortest possible production time.

<b>Waterfall Methodology</b>

The Waterfall Methodology also known as the Waterfall Model, is a sequential development process that flow like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, design, development and testing  for example) with each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins.

<b>The waterfall Method;</b>

 <b>Downsides</b>

The main drawback in waterfall method is we cannot go to back phase. So if clients need any change in back Phase we cannot do that. To do that change we have to start building again from 1st phase. Due to which a lot of time was wasted if clients need any change
      

<b>Agile Methodology</b>

The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating.

<b>Downsides</b>

It is not suitable for long term projects. One of the main drawback is that the level of collaboration is difficult to maintain

 <b> DevOps Culture</b>

   DevOps culture is all about  a shared understanding between developers and operations, and sharing responsibility for the software they build. That means increasing transparency, communication, and collaboration across development, It/ operations, and “the business”.
   
<b>History of DevOps</b>

The DevOps movement started to coalesce some time between 2007 and 2008, when IT operations and software development communities raised concerns what they felt was a fatal level of dysfunction in the industry.

 <b>DevOps</b>
 
•	DevOps is a methodology meant to improve work throughout the software development lifecycle.

•  The term DevOps is the combination of Two Words (Development and Operations)

•  DevOps is the methodology that allows a single team to manage the entire application development life cycle that is development, testing, Deployment and Operations.

•	It is a Software Development Approach through which superior quality software can be developed quickly and with more realibility.

 <b>Stages of  DevOps</b>

  There are four basic DevOps stages

•	Version Control;
                             Maintain Different version of Code.                                                    The tool used for     
Version Control is “GIT”
 

•	 Continuous Integration; Continuously Compile , build code , Integrate,   testing. The Tool Used for Continuous Integration is “Jenkins”.

•	 Continuous Delivery;
  Continuously Deploying the build app to test server.
The Tool used for Continuous Delivery is “ Maven”.

•	Continuous Deployment;
  Continuous Deploying the test app on the production.

<b>Benefits of DevOps</b>


•	Faster, better product delivery.

•	Faster issue resolution and reduce complexity.

•	Greater scalability and availability.

•	More stable operating environments.

•	Better resource utilization.

•	Greater automation.

•	Greater visibility into system outcomes.

•	Greater innovation.
